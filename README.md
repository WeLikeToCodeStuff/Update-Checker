# Software Update Checker

This is a NodeJS application you can send requests to to check if you have the correct version of a software.  
All you have to do is send a request to `example.tld/version`, and it will respond with json.
## Example
`GET /version`  
Response:  
`{"Version": "1.23.4"}`  

`GET /`  
Response:  
`{"message": "Thank you for using the WLTCS update checking system! You can find more details about it at https://github.com/WeLikeToCodeStuff/Update-Checker"}`
